I am the biggest looser I have ever seen, fuck my life, I am good for nothing .
I have zero drive to do something, I am just a mediocre joe, I can never do something great, I am the person who will do 9-5 till my death, earn bare minimum wage to eat and die. I am the saddest, pathetic, unmotivated, person i have ever met, I just know how to pretent, I dont know anything, I fear so much, I am the person who will never shoot his shot, I can only see other people doing good, everyone I knew are doing something good in life except me, I am good for nothing, I am a gutter insect, I can never figure out how to do something exceptinoally good, I will be mediocre throughout my life, I can never do good things, I am meant to be mediocre . Its the reality
